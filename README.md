WEBSTORM:

Definition of the terms: 
  
  GIT: Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. It is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of.

  GITHUB: It is an open source version control, which allows you to keep track of changes made to source codes or other documents. Multiple people can work on the same document at the same time.

  Repository: It is a directory/folder in which a project is created. The project's repository contains all of the project's files and stores each file's revision history. You can even discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

  Clone: A clone is a copy of a repository onto your computer. A clone allows you to edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without being online. The repository you cloned is still connected to the remote version so you can push the local changes to the remote version to keep them synced when you are online.

  Commit: A commit is a change to a file. When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID that allows you to keep record of the specific changes commited along with who made them and when. Commits can contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.

  Push: Push is to send your committed changes to a repository on GitHub. If you change something locally, you can push those changes so that others may access them.

  Pull: Pull is when you are fetching in changes and merging them. If someone edited the remote file then you would want to pull those changes to your local computer so that it is up to date.

  Branch: A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is made within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you make the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the master branch to publish your changes.

  Merge: Merging takes the changes from one branch and applies them into another one. A merge can be done through a pull request through GitHub web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done through command line.

  Merge Conflict: A difference that occurs between merged branches. Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. The merge conflict must be resolved before you can merge the branches.

  Fetch: When you use git fetch, you're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them. Fetching allows you to review changes before committing them to your local branch.

  Remote: This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server. Remote versions can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.
